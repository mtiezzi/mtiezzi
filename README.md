# Hi there 👋 I'm Matteo Tiezzi  

🔬 **Postdoctoral Researcher** | **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Lifelong Learning, Graph Representation Learning, Computer Vision**  
📍 Genoa, Italy | [Website](https://mtiezzi.github.io) | [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HJ2TW1YAAAAJ)  

## 🧑‍💻 About Me  
I’m a researcher in **Continual Learning, Video Understanding, Graph Neural Networks, and Sequence Modeling** with experience in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. My work has led to **32+ publications (14 first-author)** in top AI conferences (NeurIPS, AAAI, IJCAI) and journals (Nature Machine Intelligence, TPAMI, TNNLS).  

Currently, I’m at **IIT (Italian Institute of Technology)**, working on **multi-modal learning for Human-Robot Interaction**. Previously, I was at the **University of Siena**, where I developed models for sequence processing, self-supervised learning, and Continual Learning.
